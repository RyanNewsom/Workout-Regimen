# WorkoutRegimen

For anything where reps isn't stated, goal is 6-8 reps. I try to get 8 on my first sets, and on my last set if I get 6 or 7 reps, I feel that was a good amount of weight for that exercise.

## Day 1
Chest
* Barbell Bench Press, 8 sets, Add 10 lbs each set.
* Dumbbell Incline Bench Press 4 sets, Add 5 lbs each set
* Dips 4 sets

Back
* Dumbbell row 4 sets, Add 5 lbs each set
* Lat pulldown machine 4 sets, Add 5 lbs each set
* Seated row machine 4 sets, Add 5 lbs each set
* Lower back extensions, 8 sets (don't go too high on these or you'll tweak your back)

## Day 2
Abs
* Crunches 8 sets, 12 reps
* Any ab exercise where you bring your legs to your chest. 8 sets, 12 reps

Arms (Biceps)
* Barbell curl 8 sets, Add 5 lbs each set
* Dumbell curl 4 sets, Add 5 lbs each set
* Cable curl 4 sets, Add 5 lbs each set but weight isn't critical here, make sure you squeeze your biceps at the top of each rep. Most important.

Arms (Triceps)
* Close grip bench 8 sets, Add 10 lbs each set
* Tricep pulldown machine w/ flat bar, 4 sets, Add 5 lbs each set
* Tricep pulldown machine w/ rope, 4 sets, Add 5 lbs each set

## Day 3
Legs
* Squats/Leg press 4 sets, Add 10 lbs each set
* Leg curl machine 8 sets, Add 5 lbs each set
* Lunges holding 1 dumbell 4 sets, Add 5 lbs each set
* Calf raise machine 4 sets, 12 reps

Shoulders
* Barbell Shrug 4 sets, Add 5 lbs each set
* Barbell Overhead Shoulder Press, Add 5 lbs each set
* Cable upright row 4 sets, Add 5 lbs each set
* Dumbbell side lateral raises 4 sets, go light here. I use 10-15 lbs. These muscles are small.
* Reverse dumbbell lateral raises, sitting on a 45 degree bench, facing the bench. Or use machine for rear deltoids. 4 sets
* Any rotator cuff exercise for injury prevention

Repeat days 1-3 twice, then take a rest day. If you skip a day, continue where you left off and would be next. 

Notes:
* In general, want to always pyramid up
* Should take 1 hour ideally, arms/abs day takes me 90 minutes
* If you feel you are platueing, lower the weight a bit, and increase your speed
* Make sure each rep you go the full range of motion
* If your form feels wrong, it probably is
* Protein powder good, pre workout, bad. Use coffee
